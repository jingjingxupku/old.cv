      <title>Training Simplification and Model Simplification for Deep Learning: A Minimal Effort Back Propagation Method</title>

      <description>We propose a simple yet effective technique to simplify the training and the resulting model of neural networks. In back propagation, only a small subset of the full gradient is computed to update the model parameters. The gradient vectors are sparsified in such a way that only the top-k elements (in terms of magnitude) are kept. As a result, only k rows or columns (depending on the layout) of the weight matrix are modified, leading to a linear reduction in the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Unpaired Sentiment-to-Sentiment Translation: A Cycled Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://jingjingxupku.github.io/publication/sentiment/</link>

      <description>The goal of sentiment-to-sentiment “translation” is to change the underlying sentiment of a sentence while keeping its content. The main challenge is the lack of parallel data. To solve this problem, we propose a cycled reinforcement learning method that enables training on unpaired data by collaboration between a neutralization module and an emotionalization module. We evaluate our approach on two review datasets, Yelp and Amazon. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art systems.</description>
