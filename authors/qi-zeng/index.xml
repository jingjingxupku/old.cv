      <title>Review-Driven Multi-Label Music Style Classification by Exploiting Style Correlations</title>

      <description>This paper explores a new natural language processing task, review-driven multi-label music style classification. This task requires systems to identify multiple styles of music based on its reviews on websites. The biggest challenge lies in the complicated relations of music styles. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel deep learning approach to automatically learn and exploit style correlations. Experiment results show that our approach achieves large improvements over baselines on the proposed dataset.</description>

      <title>A Skeleton-Based Model for Promoting Coherence Among Sentences in Narrative Story Generation</title>

      <description>Narrative story generation is a challenging problem because it demands the generated sentences with tight semantic connections, which has not been well studied by most existing generative models. To address this problem, we propose a skeleton-based model to promote the coherence of generated stories. Different from traditional models that generate a complete sentence at a stroke, the proposed model first generates the most critical phrases, called skeleton, and then expands the skeleton to a complete and fluent sentence.</description>

      <title>An Auto-Encoder Matching Model for Learning Utterance-Level Semantic Dependency in Dialogue Generation</title>

      <description>Generating semantically coherent responses is still a major challenge in dialogue generation. Different from conventional text generation tasks, the mapping between inputs and responses in conversations is more complicated, which highly demands the understanding of utterance-level semantic dependency, a relation between the whole meanings of inputs and outputs. To address this problem, we propose an Auto-Encoder Matching (AEM) model to learn such dependency. The model contains two auto-encoders and one mapping module.</description>

      <title>Unpaired Sentiment-to-Sentiment Translation: A Cycled Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://jingjingxupku.github.io/publication/sentiment/</link>

      <description>The goal of sentiment-to-sentiment “translation” is to change the underlying sentiment of a sentence while keeping its content. The main challenge is the lack of parallel data. To solve this problem, we propose a cycled reinforcement learning method that enables training on unpaired data by collaboration between a neutralization module and an emotionalization module. We evaluate our approach on two review datasets, Yelp and Amazon. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art systems.</description>
